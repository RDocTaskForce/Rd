## Resubmission 

Per Uwe Ligges request from Jan 10, 2019 I have made the following 
changes from the previsou submission:

* Added the URL for the R Documentation Task Force information page
  <https://rdoctaskforce.github.io/> in the comment field of the 
  Authors@R entry.  I hope that this will suffice.  Please let me know 
  if there is a more appropriate way to give this information.
* I have reworded the description and extended it.  It should be more 
  clear now.
