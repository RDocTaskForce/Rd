The goal of Rd is to extend the base utilities in the `tools` and `utils` package to facilitate
creation, checking and manipulation of R documentation (Rd) objects in code.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Rd from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```r
install.packages("Rd")
```


## Examples

This is a basic example for constructing an Rd document from scratch:

```{r example}
## Recreating the first few lines of the `example` help file. 
R <- Rd_tag("\\R")
Rd( Rd_name('example'), '\n'
  , Rd_alias('example'), '\n'
  , Rd_title("Run an Examples Section from the Online Help"), '\n'
  , Rd_description( "Run all ", R, " code from the "
                  , Rd_tag("\\bold", "Examples"), " part of \n"    
                  , R, "'s online help topic ", Rd_code("topic")
                  , " with possible exceptions \n"
                  , Rd_code("dontrun"), ", "
                  , Rd_code("dontshow"), ", and "
                  , Rd_code("donttest"), ",\n see "
                  , Rd_tag("\\sQuote", "Details"), " below."
                  )
  )
```

Note that the line breaks are unnecessary for functionality,
they are included  

# Details and Internals

## Differences from core R

Rd Objects are composed of character strings and lists of character strings or nested lists 
ultimately ending in character strings.  The primary tool for reading in Rd object is the
`tools::parse_Rd()` function.  This will return a list with the base object being an `Rd` 
object but none of the elements contained are classed.  The `Rd` package extends this 
with providing more methods and functions for handling these.  In `Rd` all objects are 
S3 classed, including tags, text, code, and comments.

## Classes 

### `Rd`
This exists in the base R and is what is returned by `Rd_text('test')`. The `Rd` package
adds S3 Methods `[[`, `[`, `c`, and `format`.  `Rd` objects must be lists to be valid.

### `Rd_string`

The `Rd` text is a character string, a length one non-empty character vector.
It contains several different categories of text which is specified in the 
`Rd_tag` attribute:

* `"TEXT"` - The generic text type
* `"RCODE"` - Tagged as R code, but note that this should be wrapped by an 
              appropriate `Rd_tag` object described below.
* `"VERB"` - Symbols such as function names.
* `"COMMENT"` - Comments in Rd, each should lead with the comment character `'%'`.
* `"UNKNOWN"` - If it cannot be categorized.

It should be noted that the different types of `Rd_string` is for 
contextual identification, but for printing and formatting all are 
returned verbatim.


### `Rd_tag`
The `Rd_tag` objects are converted to the latex like `\tag` commands
when formatted for printing or writing files.  The tag to be used is stored
in the `Rd_tag` attribute.
